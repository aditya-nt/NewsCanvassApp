                                It all started with analysing stocks to analysing companies balance sheet which led to the ideation of analysing a small policy change leading to a quantum impact on the economy. With all this in mind and various policy changes and news events happening all the time it had become the need of the hour to analyse the impact and overcome the headlines phenomena because news is not just headlines.
                            </p>

                                When one says NEWS the word itself is holistic and covers all the four directions which North, East, West and South which can be encompassed to a circle one cannot even imagine. So, if one has to know a news it cannot be just the headlines but the entire story behind whatâ€™s in it for the readers. That is what our inspiration has been since inception of providing the right NEWS to our readers.
